## Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Task Execution
**Example:** "Create a research project structure with folders for literature, notes, and drafts, then create a README file explaining the purpose"

**What happens:**
1. Agent understands the request
2. Creates folder structure using `create_folder`
3. Creates README using `create_file`
4. Confirms completion

### 2. Multi-Step Reasoning
**Example:** "Analyze my project and suggest improvements"

**What happens:**
1. `get_project_structure` - Get folder tree
2. `get_file_statistics` - Analyze file distribution
3. `analyze_project_structure` - Generate insights
4. Agent synthesizes and presents recommendations

### 3. Context-Aware Assistance
**Example:** "Continue working on the report I was writing yesterday"

**What happens:**
1. `get_recent_files` - Find recently modified files
2. Identifies report file
3. `read_file` - Loads content
4. `open_file_in_tab` - Opens in editor
5. Provides summary of what was being worked on

### 4. Agent Collaboration
**Example:** "Research AI safety and write a comprehensive report"

**What happens:**
1. **Orchestrator** analyzes task → delegates to specialists
2. **Research Agent** uses `search_files` + `grep_content` → finds relevant materials
3. **Writing Agent** receives research → creates structured report
4. **Orchestrator** reviews → finalizes output
