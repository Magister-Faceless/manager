# Fixes Applied - Testing Issues Resolved

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ File and Folder Creation Tools
**Problem**: Tools were not properly creating files/folders or naming them correctly.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added project validation checks
- Improved error messages
- Added verification after creation
- Enhanced return values to include confirmation data
- Better handling of parent folder lookups

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/tools/file-tools.ts` - Enhanced `create_file` and `create_folder` tools

**What Changed**:
- Tools now verify creation was successful
- Better error messages when parent folders don't exist
- Confirmation includes the actual name and path created

### 2. ‚úÖ Scrolling in Chat Interface
**Problem**: Chat interface scrolled down automatically and prevented accessing other components.

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced `ScrollArea` component with native `div` with `overflow-y-auto`
- This allows proper scrolling behavior without interfering with other UI elements

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ChatInterface/index.tsx` - Changed ScrollArea to div with overflow-y-auto

**What Changed**:
```typescript
// Before:
<ScrollArea className="flex-1 p-4">

// After:
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto p-4">
```

### 3. ‚úÖ AI Model Description Overflow
**Problem**: Model descriptions were filling the entire screen in the select dropdown.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `max-h-[300px]` to SelectContent to limit dropdown height
- Added `max-w-[400px]` to description container
- Added `line-clamp-2` to limit description to 2 lines
- Made model name bold for better visibility

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AgentManagement/index.tsx` - Enhanced model selection UI

**What Changed**:
```typescript
<SelectContent className="max-h-[300px]">
  <SelectItem>
    <div className="flex flex-col max-w-[400px]">
      <span className="font-medium">{m.name}</span>
      <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground line-clamp-2">
        {m.description}
      </span>
    </div>
  </SelectItem>
</SelectContent>
```
