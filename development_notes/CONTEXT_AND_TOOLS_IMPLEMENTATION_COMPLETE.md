## 🎯 User Experience

### New Project Flow
```
1. User selects project folder
2. App creates .agent/ folder automatically
3. Console shows: "📁 Creating new .agent/ folder"
4. README.md created
5. User can see folder in file explorer ✅
```

### Existing Project Flow
```
1. User opens project with .agent/ folder
2. App detects existing folder
3. Console shows: "📂 Existing .agent/ folder found"
4. Existing context preserved ✅
5. Agent can read previous notes ✅
```

### Tool Selection Flow
```
1. User configures agent (orchestrator or subagent)
2. Scrolls to "Available Tools" section
3. Sees tools grouped by category
4. Checks/unchecks desired tools
5. Clicks "Select All" for categories
6. Sees tool count update (5 / 9 selected)
7. Saves configuration ✅
```

### Multi-Session Flow
```
Session 1:
- Orchestrator: "write_context_note(architecture, ...)"
- Content saved to .agent/architecture.md ✅

[App closes]

Session 2:
- Orchestrator: "list_context_notes()"
- Returns: ["architecture"] ✅
- Orchestrator: "read_context_note(architecture)"
- Gets previous findings ✅
- Continues seamlessly! ✅
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Create new project - verify .agent/ folder created
- [ ] Open existing project - verify no errors
- [ ] Check .agent/README.md exists and is readable
- [ ] Verify research/ and sessions/ subdirectories

### Context Tools Testing
- [ ] Use write_context_note - verify file created
- [ ] Use read_context_note - verify content retrieved
- [ ] Use list_context_notes - verify correct listing
- [ ] Use log_progress - verify progress.md updated
- [ ] Test append mode - verify appending works

### Tool Selection Testing
- [ ] Configure orchestrator tools - verify saves
- [ ] Create agent with custom tools - verify works
- [ ] Edit agent tools - verify updates
- [ ] Select all / deselect all - verify works
- [ ] Verify tool count updates correctly

### Multi-Session Testing
- [ ] Session 1: Write context, close app
- [ ] Session 2: Read context, verify retrieved
- [ ] Verify no context lost
- [ ] Verify timestamps preserved

### Migration Testing
- [ ] Load app with existing agents
- [ ] Verify selectedTools added automatically
- [ ] Verify default tools assigned
- [ ] Verify no errors on load

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Agent with no tools selected - should default
- [ ] Empty .agent/ folder - should populate
- [ ] Manual file edits - should not break
- [ ] Permission errors - should handle gracefully

## 📚 How To Use

### For Users: Using Context Tools

**Enable context tools for orchestrator:**
1. Go to Agent Management
2. Click Orchestrator tab
3. Scroll to "Available Tools"
4. Under "Context Management" check:
   - ✅ Write Context Note
   - ✅ Read Context Note
   - ✅ List Context Notes
   - ✅ Log Progress
5. Click "Save Configuration"

**Using in chat:**
```
User: "Analyze this codebase and remember what you learn"

Orchestrator will:
1. Analyze the code
2. Call write_context_note() to save findings
3. Files appear in .agent/ folder
4. You can read them directly!
```

### For Users: Creating Specialized Agents

**Create a research agent:**
1. Click "Create Agent"
2. Name: "Research Agent"
3. Description: "Specializes in code analysis and research"
4. Configure provider/model
5. Under "Available Tools" select:
   - ✅ Read File
   - ✅ List Files
   - ✅ Write Context Note (to save findings)
   - ❌ Write File (research only, no modifications)
6. Create Agent

### For Users: Viewing Agent Memory

**See what orchestrator knows:**
1. Open project in file explorer
2. Navigate to `.agent/` folder
3. Open `architecture.md` to see project understanding
4. Open `progress.md` to see session history
5. All files are readable Markdown! ✅

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Future Ideas
1. **UI for viewing context** - Tab to browse .agent/ files
2. **Context search** - Search across all context notes
3. **Session summaries** - Auto-generate session summaries
4. **Context pruning** - Clean up old/unused context
5. **Export context** - Export to PDF/Markdown
6. **Shared context** - Share context between projects
7. **Context templates** - Pre-filled templates for common tasks
8. **Tool usage analytics** - See which tools are used most
9. **Custom tool upload** - Let users add their own tools
10. **Tool permissions** - More granular tool access control

## 🎓 What This Enables

### Use Cases Now Possible

**1. Multi-Day Development**
```
Day 1: "Start building feature X"
- Agent saves progress to .agent/progress.md

Day 2: "Continue building feature X"  
- Agent reads progress.md
- Continues exactly where left off ✅
```

**2. Long-Term Project Understanding**
```
Over time, agent builds up knowledge:
- .agent/architecture.md grows
- .agent/research.md accumulates findings
- Agent gets "smarter" about your project ✅
```

**3. Specialized Agent Teams**
```
Research Agent: read-only tools + context writing
Writing Agent: write tools + context reading
Code Agent: all file tools + context both ways

Each agent has exactly what it needs! ✅
```

**4. Transparent AI**
```
Users can:
- Read what agent is "thinking"
- See what agent "remembers"
- Understand agent's progress
- Trust the system more ✅
```
