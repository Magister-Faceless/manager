# Tool Execution & Scrolling Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Tool Execution Not Displayed
**Problem**: The app was calling tools but not displaying the tool names, arguments, or results in the chat interface.

**Root Cause**: The stream processing code was:
- Using incorrect property names (`args` instead of `input`, `result` instead of `output`)
- Using incorrect event names (`step-start`, `step-finish` don't exist in the stream)
- Not capturing tool execution details to display to the user

**Solution**:
- Updated stream chunk processing to use correct Vercel AI SDK properties:
  - `chunk.input` for tool arguments
  - `chunk.output` for tool results
  - `chunk.text` for text deltas
- Added detailed tool execution logging that captures:
  - Tool name
  - Input parameters (formatted as JSON)
  - Output results (formatted as JSON)
  - Step numbers for each tool call
- Display tool executions in a formatted markdown section with code blocks

### 2. Scrolling Not Working
**Problem**: The messages container was not scrolling properly.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `maxHeight` constraint to the messages container: `calc(100vh - 200px)`
- This ensures the container has a fixed height and can overflow-y properly

### 3. Multi-Step Tool Execution
**Enhancement**: Improved multi-step tool execution support.

**Changes**:
- Increased `maxSteps` from 10 to 20 (configurable parameter)
- Changed from `stopWhen: stepCountIs(10)` to `stopWhen: stepCountIs(maxSteps)`
- Added `onStepFinish` callback for better debugging and monitoring
- Made `maxSteps` a parameter in both `executeWithStreaming` and `executeWithoutStreaming` methods

### 4. Message Rendering
**Enhancement**: Added proper markdown rendering for assistant responses.

**Changes**:
- Installed `react-markdown` and `@tailwindcss/typography`
- Assistant messages now render markdown with proper formatting
- Code blocks are styled with distinct backgrounds
- Tool execution details are shown with formatted JSON in code blocks

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/ChatInterface/index.tsx`**
   - Updated stream processing logic
   - Added tool execution logging
   - Added markdown rendering for messages
   - Fixed scrolling with maxHeight constraint

2. **`src/services/agent-service.ts`**
   - Added `maxSteps` parameter (default: 20)
   - Updated `executeWithStreaming` to use `stopWhen: stepCountIs(maxSteps)`
   - Updated `executeWithoutStreaming` to use `stopWhen: stepCountIs(maxSteps)`
   - Added `onStepFinish` callback for debugging

3. **`tailwind.config.js`**
   - Added `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin for prose classes

4. **`package.json`**
   - Added `react-markdown` dependency
   - Added `@tailwindcss/typography` dev dependency

## Expected Behavior

Now when a user asks the agent to create files or folders:

1. The chat will show a "Tool Executions" section with:
   - Each tool call with its name and input parameters
   - Each tool result with the output
   - Step numbers for tracking execution flow

2. Example output:
```
### Tool Executions

ðŸ”§ Step 1 - Tool: create_folder
```json
{
  "name": "docs",
  "path": ""
}
```

âœ… Result:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "path": "docs",
  "name": "docs",
  "message": "Successfully created folder: docs at docs"
}
```

ðŸ”§ Step 2 - Tool: create_file
```json
{
  "name": "README.md",
  "path": "docs",
  "content": "# Documentation"
}
```

âœ… Result:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "path": "docs/README.md",
  "message": "Successfully created file: docs/README.md"
}
```

---

I've created a docs folder and added a README.md file inside it with initial documentation content.
```

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open the app and create a new chat session
3. Configure the Orchestrator agent with your API key
4. Open a project folder
5. Ask the agent to "Create a folder called docs and add a README.md inside it"
6. Observe:
   - Tool executions are displayed with formatted JSON
   - Multiple tools are called in sequence (up to 20 steps)
   - The messages container scrolls properly
   - Results are clearly shown

## Notes

- The agent can now execute up to 20 consecutive tool calls before stopping
- Each tool execution is logged to the console for debugging
- Tool results are formatted as JSON for better readability
- The markdown renderer handles both inline code and code blocks
